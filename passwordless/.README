# 🔐 Passwordless Authentication App (Email + OTP)

A modern Android application demonstrating a **passwordless authentication flow** using **Email + OTP**, built entirely with **Kotlin and Jetpack Compose**.  
The project implements OTP generation, validation, session tracking, and analytics — all **locally**, without any backend.

---

## 📱 Features

### ✅ Email + OTP Login
- User enters an email address
- App generates a **6-digit OTP locally**
- User enters OTP to authenticate
- No password required

### 🔢 OTP Rules
- OTP length: **6 digits**
- OTP expiry: **60 seconds**
- Maximum attempts: **3**
- Generating a new OTP:
  - Invalidates previous OTP
  - Resets attempt count
- OTPs are stored **per email**

### ⏱ Session Tracking
- Displays **session start time**
- Shows **live session duration (mm:ss)**
- Session timer:
  - Survives recompositions
  - Stops correctly on logout

### 📊 Analytics Integration
- Integrated **Firebase Analytics**
- Logs the following events:
  - OTP generated
  - OTP validation success
  - OTP validation failure
  - Logout (with session duration)
- User email is **hashed** before logging (privacy-safe)

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI:** Jetpack Compose (Material 3)
- **Architecture:** MVVM (ViewModel + UI State)
- **State Management:** StateFlow
- **Concurrency:** Kotlin Coroutines
- **Analytics:** Firebase Analytics
- **IDE:** Android Studio

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

- **One-way data flow**
- **Clear separation of concerns**
- UI observes state from `ViewModel`
- Business logic isolated from UI

```

## 🔄 App Flow

1. App starts → Login Screen
2. User enters email → taps **Send OTP**
3. OTP generated locally
4. User enters OTP
5. On success → Session Screen
6. Session duration updates live
7. User logs out → App resets to login

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- OTP is **not sent via email** in this project  
  (As per requirement: *no backend required*)
- OTP is logged only for **demo/testing**
- In a production app, OTP delivery would be handled via:
  - Backend server
  - Email/SMS provider (SendGrid, Firebase Functions, etc.)

---

## 🧪 Edge Cases Handled

- Expired OTP
- Incorrect OTP
- Exceeded maximum attempts
- Resend OTP
- Screen rotation / recomposition safety

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates understanding of:
- Jetpack Compose (`@Composable`, `remember`, `rememberSaveable`, `LaunchedEffect`)
- State-driven UI and recomposition handling
- ViewModel and StateFlow
- Time-based logic
- Kotlin data structures (`Map`)
- Defensive coding practices
- External SDK integration (Firebase Analytics)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Real email OTP delivery
- Navigation Compose
- Unit tests
- Backend integration
- OTP auto-read (SMS)
- UI/UX enhancements
